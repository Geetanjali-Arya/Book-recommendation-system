Collaborative filtering based book reccommendation system using KNN

The collaborative filtering approach focuses on finding users who have given similar ratings to the same books, thus creating a link between users, to whom will be suggested books that were reviewed in a positive way. In this way, we look for associations between users, not between books. Therefore, collaborative filtering relies only on observed user behavior to make recommendations â€” no profile data or content data is necessary.
Users who rate books in a similar manner share one or more hidden preferences.
Users with shared preferences are likely to give ratings in the same way to the same books.
